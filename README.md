- I’m Marcos van Dam @mvandam
- I’m interested in adaptive optics and tools that help me simulate and implement adaptive optics systems. 
- In particular, I am interested in open source software tools. 
- The ones I currently use are yorick-yao, the PROPER optical propagation tools, which I have hacked to run with GPUs, and GDL
